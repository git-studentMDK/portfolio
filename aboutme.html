                Hi, I'm Manjunatha D, a Computer Science student from ATME college of engineering Mysore.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a passion for coding and problem-solving. My academic journey has exposed me to various programming languages like Java, Python, and C, and I'm always excited to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not buried in lines of code, I enjoy exploring the latest tech trends, participating in hackathons, and working on personal coding projects. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to shape the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking forward to collaborating on exciting coding projects and expanding my knowledge in the world of Computer Science. Let's connect and explore the world of code together!
            </p>
            <p>
